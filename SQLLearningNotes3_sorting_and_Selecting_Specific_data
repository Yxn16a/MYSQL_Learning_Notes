   -- Sorting data
------------------------------------  
  
-- Selecting distinctive data
-- 1 selecting distinctivedata
--             Distinct (Does not return duplicates)
SELECT Distinct author_lname FROM books;

-- Distinct can be used to combine objects 
SELECT Distinct(CONCAT(author_lname, author_fname)) -- this gives us the row that are Distinct 
-- on their first and last name however we can do this
SELECT Distinct author_fname, author_lname FROM books;  -- this is applied to the whole rows like
-- the following
author_fname     author_lname
| John         | Steinbeck      |
| David        | Foster Wallace |
| Dan          | Harris         |
| Freida       | Harris         |
| George       | Saunders       |
+--------------+----------------+
-- you can see that we have two Distinct Harris in our tables

-- Sorting data by ORDER BY
-- this will sort last names alphabetically
SELECT author_lname FROM books ORDER BY author_lname; 
-- WE can also order the books by title but in ascending order like the following
ysql> SELECT title from books ORDER BY title DESC;
+-----------------------------------------------------+
| title                                               |

| The Namesake

-- you can see we start from W  and move down to T in descending order
-- you can also order numbers like released_year of the book
mysql> SELECT released_year  from books ORDER BY released_year DESC

+---------------+
| released_year |
+---------------+
|          2017 |
|          2016 |
|          2016 |
|          2014 |

-- you can also have a shortcut for order by such as
SELECT title, author_lname, author_fname, released_year FROM books ORDER BY 2; -- This means that we will order
-- by author_lname.
-- you can also order by two colomns too 
-- this order by lastname, firsname means that first order by last name then order by firstName
SELECT author_lname, author_fname, released_year FROM books ORDER BY author_lname,author_fname;
-- Limit is used to show a small list
-- select the released_year in the descending by released year but I only need 5 first books
-- that are lately released

SELECT released_year from books ORDER BY released_year DESC Limit 5; -- this will give the books
-- with the released_year but only first five 
-- one means that we start from low 2 and go five row
SELECT released_year from books ORDER BY released_year DESC Limit 1, 5;
SELECT released_year from books ORDER BY released_year DESC Limit 10, 1; -- this retrives one row
-- you can use a like methode to search something that 
-- for example we can a book where the author first name has da in in as and example
-- WHERE author_lname LIKE '%da%'; -- this will search a first name that has"da" in it
SELECT author_fname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE "% da% "; -- this state that anything that
-- has da in itself will show up
SELECT author_fname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE "da%" -- this says that we select anything
-- that start with da
SELECT author_fname FROM books WHERE author_fname LIKE "%da "  -- gives us the world ended by da

-- Another tool for searching is underscores
-- where stock_quantity LIKE "_"; -- this gives the quantity that has two digits 
SELECT title, stock_quantity FROM books Where stock_quantity LIKE "____"; 
-- to find the one with percent signal
SELECT title FROM books Where title LIKE "%\%%"; -- find a book title that has a % in it

                        -- Challenges
                        
-- select all story collections or all titles with word stories in them

SELECT title From books where title LIKE "%stories%";
